## What I am most pleased with
The increase in speed along the game. This made the game more fun and challenging. I am also pleased with the look of the game as it has a simple design, yet it stands out due to the colours of each element.

## Most challenging part
Ending the game when the ball collides with the line. It was difficult to get the positions of the lines and the ball throughout the game as the lines are consistently moving and the ball can also move left and right. Hence, the position had to be updated continuously.


## Planning
I planned the project using a wireframe and Trello as shown below. The wireframe gave me an idea of how I would position elements in the game.

I first completed sprint 1 and kept a track of the current sprint. I moved each use story on Trello to show the current stage it was at.
